  <!--I realize I need to do a better job of organizing the content of my folder into separate folders, but I have had issues with double names and generally being disorganized on that front. So, based on the fact this took me a lot of time, I'm not going to mess with a good thing until it has been turned in completely. Then, I am going to go back and try to recode this from scratch, putting the style and images and java files into their respective assets and javascript and images folder-->

  <!-- Some of the styling I did entirely in the the google Debugger or inspect or whatever the correct term is. Sometimes I was confident enough to change the classes in the css, as I did for the crystal images, but other times I went with if it ain't broke, don't fix it mantra. So I feel I demonstrated I know how to do it, it was just easier sometimes to C&P from the inspect after messing around with the CSS in there-->
